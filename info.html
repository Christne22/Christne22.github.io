			   <p>
			      I was born and raised in the bay area. I moved to the Central Valley in May, 2005. My Mom was an elementary school teacher and my Dad was an electrical engineer. I remember loving computers at a young age. I spent many evenings watching my Dad work on upgrading our "desktop computer" (AKA a big bulky computer tower) components.

			   <p>
			      When I was in my early 20's I had a desire to learn how to build a website... but I was missing the technical "know-how" to make it happen - atleast in the way we are creating a webpage and a basic website this semester.  Instead... I created a basic website using Microsoft Publisher!  That LOVE of creating what can ultimately look like a beautiful graphic layout of colors & fonts, is ultimately brought me back to this class.
